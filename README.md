# Game Outcome Prediction with Logistic Regression

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the prediction of game outcomes using logistic regression. The dataset consists of several game result predictor (independent) variables and one target (dependent) variable, `win_or_defeat`.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset includes the following independent variables:

- `spell_used`
- `trap_used`
- `character`
- `position`
- `location`
- `assists`
- `damage_amount`
- `towers_damage`
- `rooms_damage`
- `deaths`
- `money_total`
- `kill_death_ratio`
- `kills_total`
- `level`
- `controlling_time`
- `total_damage`
- `earned_damage`
- `special_enemy_killed`
- `room_kills`
- `main_score`

The target variable is:

- `win_or_defeat`

## Notebook Overview

The `ml-fall-2023-practical-3-salar.ipynb` notebook covers the following topics:

1. **Data Exploration**: Understanding the data through summary statistics and visualizations.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Preparing the data for the regression model, including handling missing values and feature scaling.
3. **Model Training**: Building and training a logistic regression model to predict game outcomes.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the logistic regression model.
5. **Conclusion**: Summary of the findings and potential next steps.
